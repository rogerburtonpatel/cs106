This is my code repository for CS 106: 
Simple Virtual Machines and Language Translation.

In the repository, you'll find these directories:

  - `bin` holds compiled binaries and also scripts. 

  - `build` is a holding area for compiled files (`.o` and that ilk).
    If you are having trouble compiling, it is safe to remove
    everything from it and start over.

  - `src` contains sources that nr has provided and that I've edited:

    - `src/vscheme` contains source code for a `vscheme` interpreter.
      Use it for testing and experimentation.
    - `src/svm` contains the source code for the Simple Virtual Machine.
    - `src/uft` contains the source code for the Universal Forward Translator.
