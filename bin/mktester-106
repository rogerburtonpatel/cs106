# 
# Purpose: makes a testing file and directory for some 106 operation. 
# Details: makes a testing directory in $TESTDIR and a testing file with the
#          same name in $BINDIR. The testing file can immediately be run from
#          anywhere (assuming $BINDIR is in your $PATH), but you'll want to edit
#          it first to put in your tests. 
# 

## Usage: mktester <name-of-test-suite>
