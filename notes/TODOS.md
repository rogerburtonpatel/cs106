If you want a rant on the topic, ask me. re: parsing. Maybe?
- depth pts!!! 'the' and others

            // case InitConsCell: {
            //     struct VMBlock *vmb = vmalloc_raw(sizeof(*vmb));
            //     vmb->nslots = 0;

            // }

Globals
Cons cells
Ask about setting globals to literals

// add move instruction and short-circuit boolean logic


I recommend that your loader call svmdebug_value("unparse") to see if unparsing 
is requested, and if so, have get_instruction call printasm on every 
instruction that the loader reads.

add function sentinel to end LOADFUNC
