If you want a rant on the topic, ask me. re: parsing. Maybe?
- depth pts!!! 'the' and explode/implode and others

            // case InitConsCell: {
            //     struct VMBlock *vmb = vmalloc_raw(sizeof(*vmb));
            //     vmb->nslots = 0;

            // }

Depth:
Dynamic compilation and loading [2 points]. 
Î¼Scheme and vScheme both have a use syntactic form, which tells the interpreter 
to load and run code. This goal is to implement two machine instructions, one to
 call popen and read from a pipe, and one to load a list of modules from an open
  file descriptor. These two instructions can then eventually be used to call 
  the compiler and load the results. These instructions can be tested now, and 
  then by the time of module 4, they can be used to implement a use function.






Cons cells!!!! and clean up Eq and other instrs


Ask about setting globals to literals

FOR NORMAN: the goto in the provided vo code: returnt.vo was wrong. 
goto 5 skips over the instruction. why?

comment parser broken-- what's wrong with my code?


Add <:> operator : curry op cons + <$>

Ask about literal after @: can we have it, bc we use regs?

Any let with more than one binding is not valid. So what are all these let*s
doing? They got a lot. 

// add move instruction and short-circuit boolean logic


I recommend that your loader call svmdebug_value("unparse") to see if unparsing 
is requested, and if so, have get_instruction call printasm on every 
instruction that the loader reads.
