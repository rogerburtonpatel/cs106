Instructions that get or set global variables also use the literal form, 
but they work with the global-variable table, not with the literal pool. 
The loader needs a mapping from the name of each global variable to its 
slot number. (The slot number then determines the location via the mapping G 
described in module 1. If you want to specify the operational semantics of 
these forms, you can earn a depth point.
