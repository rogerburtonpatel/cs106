CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Roger

Not counting code that was distributed to everyone, what code was
contributed by other persons or groups?  Who were the contributors?

  - Vivian, Stephanie, and Kristen all contributed to this code. 

What work are you proud of?

  - I think my use of C-heap vs. vmheap memory was thoughtfully designed.
    I used the C-heap to store the literal pool, which is not part of the
    "VM's workable memory" (vmheap). The individual values that needed
    to be allocated inside the store were done using the vmheap, since they
    are part of that space. 

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I'd like to talk about cons cell allocation. 

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - Some of the practices: caching, data structure choice
    for memory-holding

For the first module, the instructor will present at a plenary code
review.

  - In your group, who is willing to serve on the review panel?
    
    I would be willing

  - What would you like the instructor to present at the code review?
    (Ideally, choose some distributed code that you don't understand
    or would like clarificationÂ on.)

  Cons cells! (and Block vs. Cons)
