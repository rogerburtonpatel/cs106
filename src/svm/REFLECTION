1. To claim this point, give us the number of the line of code in file vmrun.c 
that implements R ⊕ r0  in the rule for call.



2. To claim this point, give us the number of the line of code in file vmrun.c 
that computes σ(R(r)) and the line of code that updates location R′(r′) in σ.

3. To claim this point, submit files overstack.vs and overreg.vs from step 14, 
and confirm that they assemble, load, and detect overflow by the following 
commands:

uft vs-vo overstack.vs | valgrind svm
uft vs-vo overreg.vs   | valgrind svm
Confirm that

Each command causes the svm to terminate with a sensible error message.

The error messages are different in the two cases.

No memory errors are detected by valgrind.

4. To claim this point, submit the overtail.vs file from step 14, along with a 
brief explanation—one or two sentences at most—of its similarities to and 
differences from overstack.vs.

5. To claim this point, identify one important invariant that the 
representation of struct VMFunction must satisfy. (Hint: If any information is 
redundant, it must be internally consistent.)

6. To claim this point, explain how the invariant in the previous step is 
exploited in the implementation of vmrun.

7. To claim this point, answer these two questions:

Explain what, if any, is the performance benefit of using register windows in 
the SVM, as opposed to a fixed set of 256 VM registers.

Explain what, if any, is the performance cost (in your VM code) of using 
register windows in the SVM, as opposed to a fixed set of 256 VM registers.

8. When your SVM runs code that involves a call to an undefined function, 
as in the Scheme example (wait---what? 42), the error message should show the 
name of the function. To claim this point, identify the line numbers in vmrun.c 
where this error message is issued. There should be at least two locations: 
one for ordinary calls and one for tail calls.
