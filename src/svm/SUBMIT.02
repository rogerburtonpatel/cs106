What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - 

What work are you proud of?

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - 

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - 


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - 

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?
