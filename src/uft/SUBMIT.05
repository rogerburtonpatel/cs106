CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Roger

What work are you proud of?

  - Good handling of LET/LETREC cases, projection looks solid, and 
    pretty much all after-lab work was done solo. 

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - Adding the final cases to embedding and projecting def.

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - The special let case at knembemd.sml:53 -- this isn't the way
    to do it; I tried a few other permutations with asName-like
    functions. I'd like to talk about this, and why it matters. 

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - Talked a bit conceptually with Stephanie and Vivian, we worked
    in lab on disambiguate.sml:71-111. 

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - I changed the REGSLIT form, getting rid of it completely. 
    I changed the parser so it could take a list of operators:
    that was great! Felt amazing to be able to do that after 
    being shown the light and given help. Thank you. 


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes; after I add the finishing touches in lab. I'll likely resumbit
    so I can incorporate feedback before thinking about the next 
    assignment, and so I can get working uft tests. 

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I'd like to see a talkthrough of the primitive embedding/projection.
    Maybe also some UFT driver code. 

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Yes!
