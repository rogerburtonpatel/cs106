CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Roger

What work are you proud of?

  - A few assignments back, I grinded out having all the instructions in the 
    uft and svm match. It paid off here. 

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - Do we need special global cases in toReg'? codegen.sml:49. 


What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - I don't know at all what instructions that invoke 'mkclosure' look like!
    instructions.c:62-64. I also want to talk about the +imm instruction; 
    on revisiting, I realize I just don't concretely know how to conjure it up 
    in KNF, asm, or object code. 

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - Not really at all this time. But thank you to everyone I discussed with! 
    Alex, Stephanie, Vivian, Kresten, Jasper, Dennis. 

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - I used more of a parser-combinator approach to some problems in response 
  to your feedback in knproject.sml:120-123. This was also inspired by Kresten.
  Thank you both!


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - MkClosure, SetClSlot, GetClSlot, and everything closure-related. 

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Yes!
