CS 106 Homework Submission

*Realized i submitted off wrong branch*

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Roger

What work are you proud of?

  - I'm really proud of function slotIfCaptured at closure-convert.sml:67-69,
    and its use at closure-convert.sml:82 and 88. This was my first foray into
    independently creating code that pattern matches on an `option`, and it 
    seems intuitive for this case: if a variable is captured, give me its 
    slot; otherwise, give me NONE. 

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I'd like to check out my knrename code for K.CLOSURE. Matt helped me out
    with it (thank you!), and I want to see what other people have. 
    I also am curious about k-normalization of K.CLOSURE- i'd like a check on
    that. Currently, my svm can run ho-vo qsort, but 
    uft ho-kn qsort-orig.scm | vscheme 
    fails with 
    `Applied non-function r2.` I've debugged lots, with no luck. 

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - Same as above. Thank you!

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - Matt helped me with fun closure at closure-convert.sml:72-75 and with 
    knrename.sml:52-53, and stephanie helped me with clscheme.sml:56. 
    HUGE thanks to both! Week full of exams and projects; the help 
    was really appreciated. 

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - I fixed my set-difference algorithm (apparently this is just something 
    I'm bad at), and I've started to work through the laws for nicer knf. 
    Looking at module 5 and let-floating rules. These changes are at 

    1. Set stuff: knormalize.sml:37
    2. Let-floating- starting in knproject.sml:94-100. I'm copying this 
    to knormalize.sml soon. 



We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - I'd prefer next week 

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - Definitely how people handled the knrename K.CLOSURE case, and how
    they knormalized K.CLOSURE as well. 

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Yes!
