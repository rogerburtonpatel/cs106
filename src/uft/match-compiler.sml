  datatype path = REGISTER of register | CHILD of register * int
    (* in order to match block slots, children should be numbered from 1 *)

  type constraint = path * pat
    (* (π, p) is satisfied if the subject subtree at path π matches p *)

  datatype 'a frontier = F of 'a * constraint list
    (* A frontier holds a set of constraints that apply to the scrutinee.

       A choice's initial frontier has just one contraint: [(root, p)],
       where root is the scrutinee register and p is the original pattern
       in the source code.

       A choice is known to match the scrutinee if its frontier
       contains only constraints of the form (REGISTER t, VAR x).
       These constraints show in which register each bound name is stored.
    
       The key operation on frontiers is *refinement* (called `project`
       in the paper).  Refing revises the constraints under the assumption
       that a given register holds an application of a given labeled_constructor 
     *)

      about the scrutinee.  At that point, a constraint or a frontier
      may be compatible with that knowledge or incompatible *)
