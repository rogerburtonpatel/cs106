(******* Using the fixed-point combinators *****

Suppose you want to define a recursive parser for an evaluator of
sums, like this:

    exp = int <|> succeed plus <~> the "(" <*> exp <~> the "+" <*> exp <~> the ")"

where `fun plus x y = x + y`.

You can't write this in ML.  But you can use a fixed-point combinator
that is just like the Y combinator in the lambda calculus.  First,
turn the recursion equation into a function that, when given `exp`,
returns `exp`:

    exp =  int <|> succeed plus <~> the "(" <*> exp <~> the "+" <*> exp <~> the ")"

 fn exp => int <|> succeed plus <~> the "(" <*> exp <~> the "+" <*> exp <~> the ")"

Then pass the whole thing to `fix`:
  
 fix (fn exp => int <|> succeed plus <~> the "(" <*> exp <~> the "+" <*> exp <~> the ")")

The result is your parser.

(The knot is tied using a mutable reference cell that is deferenced every
time tokens are delivered, so it's reasonably efficient.)
